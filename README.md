#THE ALPHA STORE
Welcome to THE ALPHA STORE, a dynamic and responsive front-end concept for a gaming hardware e-commerce website. This project showcases a complete thematic and stylistic transformation of an existing web template into a modern, visually appealing storefront for gaming laptops, mobiles, and accessories.

The focus of this project was to apply front-end development skills to re-brand a website, enhancing its UI/UX with modern CSS effects and interactive JavaScript to fit a new, energetic target audience.



üöÄ Features
Fully Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops, using modern CSS Flexbox and Grid.

Interactive UI Elements:

Sticky Header: The navigation bar remains fixed at the top for easy access when scrolling.

Clickable Brand Logos: Brand logos in the footer are hyperlinked to their respective official websites.

Back-to-Top Button: Appears on scroll to allow for quick navigation.

Modern CSS Graphic Enhancements:

Gradient Text: Main section titles feature a vibrant color gradient for visual appeal.

Glowing Product Cards: Product cards lift up and emit a soft glow on hover, creating a dynamic user experience.

Frosted Glass Header: The sticky header uses a backdrop-filter to create a modern, translucent "frosted glass" effect over the content scrolling underneath.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure and content of the website.

CSS3: For all styling, layout, responsiveness, and advanced visual effects.

JavaScript: For interactivity and dynamic changes based on user actions like scrolling.
